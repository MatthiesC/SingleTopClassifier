# SingleTopClassifier

A DNN for the highly boosted tW measurement using Keras/TensorFlow.


## DNN configuration

Configuration should be done within these files:
* `SampleClasses.py`: Specify which classes (physical processes like tW, TTbar, WJets etc.) you want to use for the multi-class DNN.
* `InputDefinition.py`: Specify which input variables you want to use, i.e. how the DNN input vector looks like.
